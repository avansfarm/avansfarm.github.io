Guest House Rental Policies 

Reservations:  Reservations can be confirmed by using  Visa, Mastercard, American Express, or Discover.  There is a minimum two night stay.

Check in/Out: The Guest House will be ready anytime after 3:00 PM central time. If you need to arrive earlier or will be coming in later than 8:00 PM, just let us know a little before hand. Check out is at 11 AM, central time unless prior arrangements are made with the owner. 

Cancellations: Due to our small operation, cancellations can harm our business without enough advance notice. We request a 1 week notice of cancellation. Anytime less than that there will be a $50.oo per night reserved charge.

Children: Children are welcome, but parents must watch their children closely due to their being so many things on a farm that children will need adult supervison to explore. Parents and guardians will be required to sign a liability release form before being able to participate in farm activites and farm exploration.

Smoking: We are a smoke free facility, but we will allow smoking outside on the porches. 

Pets: Maisy, Snoop, Molly, Patches, Tiger, Tweet, Tinkerbell, Tiger, Daisy, and Chester will provide you with all the pet fix that you'll need while you are here.   In addition, the horses can be your pets for the weekend too.
