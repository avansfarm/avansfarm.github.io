		Avans Farm is located on 62 acres of forest and pasture land.   When we first purchased the property in February 1999, we only had 9.62 acres.  Before the end of the year, we had added 47 more then in 2006, we bought the house next door and renovated the structure.  This is now the guest house. Most of the property was not accessible in 1999, but the addition of a bulldozer in 2000 helped cure that problem.  There are approximately 5 miles of trails with 2.6 clearly marked.  These trails are through the forest for nature viewing by horseback, golf cart, or foot.  We actually do the hayrides through the woods on these trails.
