	  We are located in Smith County Tennessee 50 miles east of Nashville and 110 miles west of Knoxville on I-40 and travel about 4 miles south.                             

		 In the Fall we decorate our trails, offer hayrides, hot dog and marshmellow roasts for groups or individuals. This would be a great time to plan for a family or group outing while the temperatures are pleasant and the leaves are gorgeous.

		The farm is nestled in the hills of Tennessee on 135 forested and pastured acres with 4.5 miles of clearly marked trails.
