		From our guest book .................................

February 2009 -- ( Our first paying guests) Tony and Joanne -- Thanks so much fo your kindness and hospitality this weekend.  You thought of everything!  The chalet is beautiful.  We hope to come back and scrapbook again soon!  Mary, Robin, Dianna, and Marty -- Lacassass, Tennessee

March 2009 -- Tony & Joanne -- Thank you so much for everything .  We love your place and can't wait to come back!!  Chris, Christina, and Cyrus Pischel  -- Spring Hill, Tennessee

May 2009 -- Tony & Joanne -- From the moment Rob and I arrived at the farm - from hospitality to accommodations - exceeded our expectations.  We've only stayed two nights ... and we're already devising a way to visit again.  The farm, for me in particular, has been a retreat for healing and peace - a perfect getaway from my fast paced and high pressure work life.  Tony has a sense of calm and strength, experience and deep love which we began to encounter on our horseback ride with him through the 5 mi. trail in the woods.  Joanne is a warm spirit comforting and radiates joy in all she does in and on the farm.  Our cabin was absolutely picture perfect clean, orderly, comfortable - the perfect environment to clear your head and just be.  My deepest gratitude came while chopping fresh vegetables and making guacomole in the kitchen.  Somehow this task, so simple, meant so much since all the ingredients (and my favorite blue corn chips) were right here waitng for me.  Rob and I have deeply enjoyed our stay -- and getting to know two amazing spirits which guide and lead this beautiful place. I can't wait to come again in the fall and maybe bringing friends.  With deep gratitude, Suzy Holmes and Rob Youngquist -- Minneapolis, Minnesota

Dear Joanne, Tony, Babe, Scarlett, and Midnight --  Thank you for our lovely stay.  What a spectacular weekend we've had here at your farm.  I am confident that my brothers and I would not have been able to reproduce this experience at any other destination, and that we will not forget the gracious hospitality and clean, comfortable accomodations of the Avans Family Farm.  Thank you folks and we will now hatch a plan to coerce our "significant others" to the area so that we may come back again.  All the best, and util we meet again,  -- Mike, Will, and Matt Wininger, hailing from Windsor, Conneticut.

June 2009 -- Tony and Joanne,  Dee Dee and I had such a wonderful time here at your farm/B&B/retreat. We got to do everything even drive a bulldozer.  Not many places can you go and say you got to drive a bulldozer and push a couple tons of rock around.  We loved everthing from relaxing to riding the horses and of course getting to meet the two of you.  We look forwad to making another stay here and getting to see you all again.  Thank you, Peter & Dee Dee Harrington -- McDonough, Ga.

Dear Tony and Joanne Thank you so much for the wonderful weekend.  Ben and I had such an unforgettable weekend.  Everything was so lovely and beautiful.  Both of you made or 25th anniversary so special.  We hope to come back real soon.  Your retreat is so beautiful and quiet.  All of the touches were just right.  Thank you again and God Bless you.  Ben and Tammy Chandler -- McDonough, Ga. 

Mr. & Mrs.  Avans - Thanks for this amazing experience.  The guest house was very nice and had everthing we might need.  The horses were really fun too.  All of the girls had a great time and have already started talking about coming back.  thanks again for being such great hosts and giving us a good time!   We'll definately spread the word and hopefully we'll be back in the near future.  Girl Scout Troop 2533 -- Franklin, Tennessee

Tony & Joanne -- Thank you for an amazing weekend!  What a wonderful place to call home for a weekend and that's exactly how you made us feel.  I will always cherish this place -- the first place my children ever got to ride a horse!  We loved our time and will return!  Give Ben (one of our dogs) extra kisses and Midnight (one of our horses) extra oats!!!.  We love you both -- Thank you for your service to our Country and God with this "Wonderful Place" as Alex said.  Blessings -- The DelGiorno's -- Franklin, Tennessee

 July 2009 -- Dear Tony and Joanne,  Thanks you for letting us not only into your guest house, but also into your life.  We really enjoyed our time together with you.  You gave us all that we needed to relax and forget about the world we escaped.  Although he is still small, I'm positive that Simon learned a lot about farm life.  We will always remember his "firsts" here - first experience with a horse - first trip away from home.  It was just what we all needed!  Thank you again for being so well prepared for us and helping us have such a great time!  Nichole, Gabriel and Simon Neuhard.  Burlington, Kentucky 

Thank you for letting us stay the weekend.  We had a great time.  It is so peaceful and nice here.  I love the horses and the house is amazing.  We will be seeing you soon I'm sure -- Crystal and Ricky Ratliff -- Mt. Croghan, South Carolina                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Avans,    Josh's graduation party was terrific!!  Thanks so much for being such a gracious host and hostess.  Everyone had a great time from tiny babes to seniors like me!  How many wheelchair folks can say they've been on a hayride?  That was such fun!!!  I enjoyed all aspects of your beautiful farm including visiting with you folks, seeing your home, and the bonfire with yummy smores.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!   God bless your ministry!   Gratefully, Carolyn Heizer

Dear Tony and Joanne,  I just wanted to drop you a note to say how much we enjoyed our weekend with you.  It was like visiting family.  You made us feel very at home.  Your party was great too, as always.  Our whole family is looking forward to next time.  The girls are already asking when we can go back.  I feel bad because we didn'tget any pictures- we were having way too much fun.  Carter, Michelle & company.

Dear Tony & Joanne:  Thank you for an absolutely glorious day on your farm yesterday.  You two are the most gracious hosts, and I thoroughly enjoyed each activity we shared, along with the beauty of the surroundings.  I think we have all found a piece of heaven at your farm!  Warmly, Alesa Rotterman 

Thanks for sharing your beautiful place in the country.  I told Pat it should be called "Avans Haven" because that is what it is.  A place to get away from all the stress of everyday life.  Thanks again for a wonderful time.  Peggy & Pat Patton

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Avans - We love you and we got to go fishing and it was a lot of fun and thank you that the kids got fish. Thank you that we got to roast marshmallows and hotdogs.  I got to see all the decorations on the trails for miles. Thank you I saw Elmo on the hayride.  Love Andrew.
